Lightning talks
Due to the amount of lightning talks submitted we have had to split them over two days with most on Wednesday and some on Friday. Please plan to speak for between 7 to 8 minutes. 

Presentations
These are in 1.5 hour sessions and are grouped into 3 presentations. Each presentation should last for around 27mins including time for questions to leave time for the next presenter to get setup.  

Panels
These are set for 1.5 hours and should include time for questions and audience participation. 

For further details on the conference please see the conference website:
