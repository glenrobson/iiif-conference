Your proposal has been accepted and we look forward to hearing your talk at the conference. We are planning to put together the program over the next three weeks and this may result in some switching between formats of presentations in a small number of cases. We hope this won't be necessary but if this is required we will be in contact.

We will publish the information you submitted in the proposal to the conference website and we would be grateful if you could let us know of any changes that are required to the following before the 13th of March:
